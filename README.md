Invent With Python ported to PySDL2
===================================

This is a project aiming to port all the code/games from the book
["Making Games with Python & Pygame"](http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/) by Al Sweigart
from pygame to PySDL2.

## Why?

Well, I'm mostly a C/C++ programmer and I use SDL2 for my games/demos and
I wanted to be able to prototype in python with a library that'd make
it very easy to go from that to C.  PySDL2, while it does have some
great convenience classes/API's in the sdl2.ext, it's not hard to look
into the source and see what they're actually doing.  In addition it has
the sdl2 module, which is a straight 1:1 wrapper of SDL2, as well as
1:1 wrappers of SDL2 libraries like SDL2_mixer, SDL2_gfx and SDL2_ttf.
This design also makes using PySDL2 a great way to learn the SDL2
API and related libraries in general.

Another advantage of PySDL2 is that it's public domain/CC0/zlib instead of LGPL.

for more details on the differences between Pygame and PySDL2


## Status
I've ported 10 of the projects, though the 4 of hardly count being so simple, or
in the case of tetromino for idiots, only a few lines different from tetromino.
They all (should) work with python 2.7 and python 3.x though I think I may drop
python 2 in the future.  They're mostly straight ports not redesigns/reimplementations,
so it's easy to compare/learn (I've left all the pygame versions in the repo).  In other
words, I keep as much of his functions/code structure as possible.  I have
about 7 more games to go and various improvements in the first half and general maintenance.

One other thing to note.  I am using a local copy of PySDL2 with 1 change, modifying
SpriteRenderer.render() behavior.  I've changed it so that it does *not* call
SDL_RenderPresent/SDL_UpdateWindowSurface. I've created an [issue](https://bitbucket.org/marcusva/py-sdl2/issues/91/spriterenderer-render-behavior-change) to
discuss the design/behavior of that function and why it should change,
but even if the change is merged I'll keep a local copy in the repo for
convenience and because I'll change/add other minor things.

## License
All original content/code is copyrighted by Al Sweigart and as you can see
at the top of his py files, is BSD licensed.  All my code is public domain,
fallback to MIT/BSD.  I may change/expand/formalize the fallback later but
take it, do whatever you want with it, is the gist if public domain doesn't
work obviously.
