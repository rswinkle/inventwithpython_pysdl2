<h1>Invent With Python ported to PySDL2</h1>

<p>This is a project aiming to port all the code/games from the book
<a href="http://inventwithpython.com/pygame/chapters/">"Making Games with Python &amp; Pygame"</a> by Al Sweigart
from pygame to PySDL2.</p>
<h2>Download</h2>
<p>Get the source at <a href="https://github.com/rswinkle/inventwithpython_pysdl2">Github</a></p>
<h2>Why?</h2>
<p>Well, I'm mostly a C/C++ programmer and I use SDL2 for my games/demos and
I wanted to be able to prototype in python with a library that'd make
it very easy to go from that to C.  PySDL2 does have some
great convenience classes/API's in the sdl2.ext module, but it's not hard to look
into the source and see what they're actually doing.  In addition it has
the sdl2 module, which is a straight 1:1 wrapper of SDL2, as well as
1:1 wrappers of SDL2 libraries like SDL2_mixer, SDL2_gfx and SDL2_ttf.
This design also makes using PySDL2 a great way to learn the SDL2
API and related libraries in general.</p>
<p>Look <a href="https://pysdl2.readthedocs.org/en/latest/tutorial/pygamers.html">here</a>
for more details on the differences between Pygame and PySDL2</p>
<p>In any case, I started this project as a way of learning PySDL2 and I think will
be useful for people trying to learn PySDL2 whether or not they have
experience with Pygame and it'll be a convenient way for people to get a feel
for both API's if they're trying to pick one.</p>
<h2>Status</h2>
<p>I've ported the first 8 programs, though the first 3 aren't actually games.
I have 9 more but 2 are just variations of 2 that I've already done.</p>
<p>They all (should) work with python 2.7 and python 3.x though I think I may drop
python 2 in the future.  They're mostly straight ports not redesigns/reimplementations,
so it's easy to compare/learn (I've left all the pygame versions in the repo).  I have
about 7 more games to go and various improvements in the first half and general maintenance.</p>
<h2>License</h2>
<p>All original content/code is copyrighted by Al Sweigart and as you can see
at the top of his py files, is BSD licensed.  All my code is public domain,
fallback to MIT/BSD.  I may change/expand/formalize the fallback later but
take it, do whatever you want with it, is the gist if public domain doesn't
work obviously.</p>
